# Alfresco_Backup

For some reason the Alfresco server crashed after a server reboot, I couldn't put it back on so I decided to restore the files and reupload in a new server. To do so I used the postgres dump file of the database and the contentstore folder, hosted the database locally to access the information I needed and recreated the directory.
